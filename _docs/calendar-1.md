docs-question: To add events to the calendar
docs-category: calendar
---
The calendar is managed by a third party service.  Login to <a href="https://tockify.com">Tockify</a>.

After logging in, open the calendar editor.

Create a new event and save the changes.

If the event repeats weekly, make sure to add in that information.

If the event repeats more than one day a week, create a new event and select the additional day of the week that programming happens.

This will update automatically on the GWCC website.
